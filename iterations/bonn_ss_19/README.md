## Lectures

The core lectures are available [here](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/microeconometrics/blob/master/README.md).

#### Kickoff

* [Introduction to students](https://github.com/peisenha/intro_to_students/blob/master/dist/eisenhauer-introduction.pdf)

I briefly introduce my research background and provide a basic overview on my teaching efforts.

* [Course details](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/microeconometrics/blob/master/iterations/bonn_ss_19/00_course_outline.pdf)

We discuss some details about the course and in particular student projects.

* [OpenSourceEconomics](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics)

We briefly present our efforts around this student run initiative.

## Guest lecturers

We are lucky to draw on a set of guest lecturers for our different topics.

#### [SeBecker](https://github.com/sebecker) on [OpenSourceEconomics](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics) and [grmpy](https://grmpy.readthedocs.io)

Sebastian will present on the efforts around the OpenSourceEconomics Initiative and his work on the `grmpy` package.

#### [janosg](https://github.com/janosg) on [Structural Microeconometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_estimation) and [respy](http://respy.readthedocs.io)

Janos will present on structural microeconometrics models and his work on the `respy` package.

## Student projects

We will run student projects for grading and heavily rely on [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com). All details regarding the projects are available [here](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/student-project-template).

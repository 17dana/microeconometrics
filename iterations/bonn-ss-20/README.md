## Lectures

The core lectures are available [here](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/microeconometrics/blob/master/README.md).

#### Kickoff

* [Introduction to students](https://github.com/peisenha/intro_to_students/blob/master/dist/eisenhauer-introduction.pdf)

I briefly introduce my research background and provide a basic overview on my teaching efforts.

* [OpenSourceEconomics](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics)

We briefly present our efforts around this student run initiative.

## Guest lecturers

We are lucky to draw on a set of guest lecturers for our different topics.

#### [SeBecker](https://github.com/sebecker) on [OpenSourceEconomics](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics) and [grmpy](https://grmpy.readthedocs.io)

Sebastian will present on the efforts around the OpenSourceEconomics Initiative and his work on the `grmpy` package.

#### [janosg](https://github.com/janosg) on [Structural Microeconometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_estimation) and [respy](http://respy.readthedocs.io)

Janos will present on structural microeconometrics models and his work on the `respy` package.

## Python Challenge

As discussed in class there will be a small Python challenge. See below for further details.

**Challenge**: Production of a minimal working example of the _Simpson's Paradox_ (that is, simulating data etc.) including at least one plot (see [Simpson Paradox Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox) for the wikipedia article and see [Simpson Paradox Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebEkn-BiW5k) for the tl;dr youtube explanation by minutephysics).

**Submission**: The solutions ought to be submitted as a seperate `.py` or `.ipynb` file in your student project repositories. This also means that the deadlines of the challenge and your projects coincide. The metric that will be used for ranking of the solutions is given by some convex combination of brevity and elegance, but will ultimately be decided by Phillip Eisenhauer.

**Price**:
* Copy of  ["The Book of Why" (Judea Pearl, 2018)](https://www.amazon.de/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/0141982411/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1560794216&sr=8-1)
* Drinks on Philipp Eisenhauer at the prize ceremony
* Code review and potentially a heated debate on the limits of statistics in economics with Phillip Eisenhauer and [Tim Mensinger](https://github.com/timmens)


## Student projects

We will run student projects for grading and heavily rely on [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com). In this project you are asked to summarize and reproduce core results of an empirical paper of your choice. Please select an article that interests you but also allows you to access the data used in the analysis. Also, for a good grade you need to add some analysis of your own. This can take very different forms. For example, you could create some visualizations that make the paper more accessible to interested readers, investigate the sensitivity of results to the author's modeling choices, or add some additional robustness checks.

All details regarding the projects are available [here](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/student-project-template).

* **Do we need to report on the progress of our project?** Yes, I will frequently select a student project at random to report on their current state at the end of a lecture.

* **When is the student project due?** We need to finish working on our projects by noon on 08/04/19.

* **Why are the projects public?** Transparency and reproducibility is a core value in research. Also, we want to learn from each other.

* **When do I need to sign up for the project?** You need to sign up for the class between 04/08/19 - 04/14/19.

* **How can I initialize the repository for my student project?** Please just follow this invitation [link](https://classroom.github.com/a/KaOMTvKj).

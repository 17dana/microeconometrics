## Lectures

The core lectures are available [here](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/microeconometrics/blob/master/README.md).

#### Kickoff

* [Introduction to students](https://github.com/peisenha/intro_to_students/blob/master/dist/eisenhauer-introduction.pdf)

I briefly introduce my research background and provide a basic overview on my teaching efforts.

* [OpenSourceEconomics](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics)

We briefly present our efforts around this student run initiative.

## Student projects

We will run student projects for grading and heavily rely on [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com). In this project you are asked to summarize and reproduce core results of an empirical paper of your choice. Please select an article that interests you but also allows you to access the data used in the analysis. Also, for a good grade you need to add some analysis of your own. This can take very different forms. For example, you could create some visualizations that make the paper more accessible to interested readers, investigate the sensitivity of results to the author's modeling choices, or add some additional robustness checks.

All details regarding the projects are available [here](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/student-project-template).

* **Do we need to report on the progress of our project?** Yes, I will frequently select a student project at random to report on their current state at the end of a lecture.

* **When is the student project due?** TBD

* **Why are the projects public?** Transparency and reproducibility is a core value in research. Also, we want to learn from each other.

* **When do I need to sign up for the project?** TBD

* **How can I initialize the repository for my student project?** Please just follow this invitation [link](https://classroom.github.com/a/KaOMTvKj).

# Datasets

This directtory contains the prepared datasets from the course textbook. The full set of STATA files is available in the *archive* subdirectoy.

The notebook *preparations.ipynb* takes selected data files that are actually used during the course and after some minor preparations stores them as a *pandas* dataframe.
